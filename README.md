# My CV
[https://psoares.dev](https://psoares.dev)

## Context

- **What is this?**\
This project is a nextjs react app for my CV.

- **Why am I killing a fly with a cannon? :sweat_smile:**\
Besides the necessity of having an online CV since I work as contractor and freelance in a lot of projects, I've decided to turn this into a small code display.

- **Can anyone clone the repo and use it?**\
Yes, sure. Anyone can use this for the CV app. What I would like to ask is to add credit to my github user, mentioning the original repo on your fork :wink:

## Basic instructions

- Clone it

- Be sure you have the [right node version](./.nvmrc)\
*I use [NVM](https://github.com/nvm-sh/nvm) to manage versions*

- Run `$ yarn install`

- Run `$ yarn dev`

- Edit the `config.js` - You'll get how it works :smile:
